        <p>Pakistan is located in South Asia and shares borders with India to the east, Afghanistan and Iran to the west, and China to the north. To the south, it has a coastline along the Arabian Sea. The country is geographically diverse, featuring mountains (including the famous K2 in the Karakoram range), plains, deserts, and a long coastal strip. Pakistan has a mixed economy, with agriculture, industry, and services all playing key roles. The country is one of the world's largest producers of textiles and garments and also has a significant agricultural sector, particularly in crops like wheat, rice, cotton, and sugarcane. However, the economy faces challenges such as political instability, security concerns, corruption, and a large informal sector.</p>
